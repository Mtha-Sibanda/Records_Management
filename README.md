# Records_Management

This is a program that allows the user to add, edit and view all employees that are in a company.

Currently it uses a vector as a database and uses the name string as the look up value.

Later this will be changed such that the data is written to a file so it is stored even after it is closed.
It will also use an Employee ID as the lookup rather than the name.
